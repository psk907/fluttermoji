## Usage Instructions
1. Depend on it by importing your package in the ```pubspec.yaml```  file.
	```yaml
	dependencies:
          fluttermoji: latest_version
	```
2. Add the following import to your .dart file
	```dart
	import 'package:fluttermoji/fluttermoji.dart';
	```
3. Add the FluttermojiCircleAvatar widget to display your Fluttermoji where needed.
	```dart
	FluttermojiCircleAvatar();
	```
4. To allow your users to personalize their Fluttermoji, add the following widget and pair it with the above one in your page.
	```dart
	FluttermojiCustomizer();
	```

That's all it takes, simple right ? The two widgets communicate with each other and update in real-time throughout your widget tree.

##  Usage Guidelines
The package offers a ton of features in the simplest way possible, however there are some points worth noting.

- `FluttermojiCircleAvatar` only renders the local user's avatar. To display the avatar of other users', you'll have to use the `SvgPicture.string()` method from `flutter_svg` .
- `FluttermojiCircleAvatar` would render a default avatar until customized and saved by the local user for the first time.
- Use the `canvaskit` renderer when building for web, the default `html` renderer will not work with SVGs.
- The fluttermoji's attributes are saved to local app/browser storage. Clearing app/browser data would mean clearing these attributes as well.
- You can create a `FluttermojiThemeData` instance to configure the look and feel of the widgets to your liking.
